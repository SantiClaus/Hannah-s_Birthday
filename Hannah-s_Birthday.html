		<p>Happy 18th birthday to the best girlfriend and best friend in the whole world! I'm so happy to be here for such a big day in your life, and I'll definitely be there for many more birthdays to come! Everyday I spend with you is better than the last, and I fall in love with you more and more everyday. We may have a little trouble some days, but we always find a fix for them in the end. I love you more than anything in the whole world! And I'll love you forever, no matter what! I love you buddy :) <span style="color: red">&#9829;</span></p>
